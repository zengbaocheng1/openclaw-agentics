# URDF Generation

Regenerate explicit URDF outputs from Python sources with top-level `gen_urdf()` functions.

```bash
python scripts/urdf path/to/assembly.py
python scripts/urdf path/to/assembly.py -o path/to/robot.urdf
python scripts/urdf path/to/a.py=out/a.urdf path/to/b.py=out/b.urdf
```

Plain Python targets write a sibling `.urdf` beside the source. `-o`/`--output` is valid only with one plain target. Use `SOURCE.py=OUTPUT.urdf` pairs for custom multi-target destinations.

`gen_urdf()` must be a top-level zero-argument function returning the root `xml.etree.ElementTree.Element`, a complete URDF XML string, or an accepted envelope whose only field is `xml`. See `references/generator-contract.md`.

Relative source targets and CLI output paths resolve from the current working directory.

## Default Validation Behavior

The generation command validates the generated URDF before accepting the output. There is no separate validation-only command in this skill.

A generation failure should be treated as a model or source problem, not as a reason to hand-edit the generated `.urdf`. Fix the generator source, then regenerate the explicit target.

The generation-time validation is intended to catch compact robot-description issues such as:

- malformed XML or wrong root element;
- missing or duplicate link and joint names;
- invalid parent/child references;
- multiple roots, disconnected graphs, or cycles;
- suspicious joint limits, axes, origins, geometry, mesh references, or inertials when supported by the runtime.

## Boundaries

This tool runs only `gen_urdf()`. It does not regenerate CAD, mesh/export, GLB/topology, render, SDF, SRDF, MoveIt2, or simulator outputs.

If URDF visual/collision mesh references depend on updated CAD or mesh outputs, regenerate those explicit targets separately with the owning CAD or mesh workflow, then regenerate the affected URDF.

## Failure Handling

When generation-time validation fails:

1. inspect the reported links, joints, mesh references, or inertial fields;
2. update the source generator, design ledger, or referenced assets;
3. regenerate the same explicit URDF target;
4. do not patch the generated `.urdf` directly unless the task is explicitly forensic and the patch will not be treated as source of truth.
